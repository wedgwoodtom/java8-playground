 * Bounded Type Parameters
 * <p>
 * There may be times when you'll want to restrict the kinds of types that are allowed to be passed to a type parameter. For example, a method that operates on numbers might only want to accept instances of Number or its subclasses. This is what bounded type parameters are for.
 * <p>
 * To declare a bounded type parameter, list the type parameter's name, followed by the extends keyword, followed by its upper bound.
